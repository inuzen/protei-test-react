### Test exercise for protei


### The task

Fetch data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and represent it as table
with columns as follows:

Username | City | Publication title | Number of comments


## Conditions:

 - Use TypeScript and React or Angular 8+ (note: in this release typescript is not used)
 - No UI frameworks

 - Clicking on table header sorts contents (done)
 - Repeat clicks change the sorting direction (done)
 - Sorting order represented by an icon (done)
 - Currently sorted table header must be highlighted in bold font (done)

## Additional conditions
- Clicking on publication title row opens a modal with this publication text and comments to it (done)
- Add filters for columns (done)
- Add search by text for publications (done)
Note: I made filters interconnected so it filters based on all of them together.

Also tried to make it scalable instead of just hardcoded values
